        <p class="p-margin">Hi! I'm Nason and I love creating great websites. From the age of 7, I have always been fascinated by technology and how things work. When I discovered the internet I was amazed of the possibities that were just a click away, how the world had suddenly been connected, all the lives it had changed, businesses it helped grow. </p>
        <img src="images/connectivity.jpg" alt="">
        <p>After completing highschool I decided to join a prestigous coding school, <a href="http://moringaschool.com/">MoringaSchool</a>, where  I could get the best skills for proper coding. This is where I currently reside.</p>
        <p>upon completion I hope to be a one of a kind developer who can make webpages come to life.</p>
        <p>When I am not coding or learning how to code, I am usually hanging out with my family, workingout, doing Do It Yourself projects or catching up on the latest science and technology advancements.</p>
